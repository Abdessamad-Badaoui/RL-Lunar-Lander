# Reinforcement Learning : Lunar Lander environment

## Introduction

This project explores the application of Deep Q-Learning (DQN) to train an agent to optimally control a lunar lander in a simulated environment. The focus is on investigating the impact of various hyperparameter settings on the agent's performance.

## Project Goals

Implement a DQN agent to learn a policy for successfully landing the lunar lander.

Evaluate the impact of different hyperparameter configurations on the agent's learning and performance.

Identify optimal or near-optimal hyperparameter settings for the chosen DQN architecture.
